# ECHO DUNGEON VERSION 8.5
## A VOICE CONTROLLED DUNGEON ADVENTURE

---

## A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER

Hello, my name is Asa Hartz. I created Echo Dungeon for my wife, who lost her sight over the last six years due to diabetic retinopathy. I watched as the games she loved became inaccessible to her, and I decided to build something she could play entirely by voice.

This game is my gift to her, and to anyone in the blind and visually impaired community who wants to experience the joy of dungeon crawling adventures. It is completely free, and it will always be free.

I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it for the person I love most.

## WHAT IS ECHO DUNGEON?

Echo Dungeon is a fully voice controlled dungeon crawler. You explore dangerous dungeons, fight monsters, collect treasures, and level up your hero. Everything is controlled by your voice. Everything is read aloud to you. No screen reading software needed. No keyboard. No mouse. Just your voice and the adventure.

## HOW TO GET STARTED

### STEP 1: INSTALLATION
Extract all files to a folder on your computer. Open the file named index dot html in your web browser. Chrome or Edge work best.

### STEP 2: ALLOW MICROPHONE ACCESS
Your browser will ask permission to use your microphone. Click yes or allow. The game needs your microphone to hear your commands.

### STEP 3: BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE
You will hear: "Echo Dungeon V8 is ready. Tap the screen to begin."

Tap anywhere on your screen. The game will ask you to choose a class.

Say either: "Warrior" or "Mage" or "Rogue"

Then your adventure begins.

---

## HOW TO PLAY

### THE BASIC PATTERN
1. Tap the screen. You will hear a slight change in background tone when listening.
2. Speak your command clearly.
3. The game responds and tells you what happens.
4. Tap again when ready for your next command.

That's it. Tap, speak, listen. Repeat.

## CHOOSING YOUR CLASS

**WARRIOR**
The warrior is strong and tough. High health. Strong attacks. Can use shields. Special ability: Power Strike. Good for beginners.

**MAGE**  
The mage uses powerful magic. Lower health but high mana. Devastating spells. Special ability: Fireball. Good for players who like magic.

**ROGUE**
The rogue is balanced and sneaky. Can pick locks. Quick attacks. Special ability: Backstab. Good for strategic players.

All three classes are fun. Choose what sounds interesting to you.

## VOICE TIPS

Speak clearly and naturally. Wait for the listening indicator. The screen background will turn slightly green when the game is listening.

If a command is not recognized, try rephrasing. For example:
- Instead of "I want to go north", say "north"
- Instead of "can I search this room", say "search"
- Instead of "let me use a health potion", say "use potion"

Shorter commands work better than long sentences.
